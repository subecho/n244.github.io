I was born and raised in the Seacoast area of New Hampshire and, like the rest
of N244, I attended the University of New Hampshire. I graduated in 2012 with my
Bachelors and in 2013 with a Masters, both in Computer Science. In late 2015, I
decided I was sick of the snow and moved to the Bay Area. I currently work for
Zignal Labs in San Francisco as a Backend Engineer. My current focuses are
Elasticsearch, API design and implementation and big data pipeline technologies.

Scala is my language of choice. For the uninitiated, Scala has full support for
functional programming and a very strong static type system. It was designed to
be concise and was inspired by criticism of the shortcomings of Java. In
addition to Scala, functional programming, and the technologies I use at work,
I spend of time working on the "soft skills." I read and think a lot about best
development practices. One day, Pocket is going to tell me I have collected too
many articles about developer tools and text editors. I am very interested,
borderline obsessed, with self improvement. I am always looking gathering and
implementing productivity techniques. If you'd heard of a to do app, I've
probably tried it.

In my spare time, I play ultimate frisbee, homebrew, and continue my quest in
search of the best burritos/tacos/fried pickles/fried calamari/sushi/pizza.
Probably other too. Oh, fried chicken sandwiches too. For sure, fried chicken
sandwiches.

_Projects I will get to one day:_
- Starting a blog _In progress ;)_
- HJson for scala
- BARTbot for Hipchat
- RSS Reader + AI
- Recipe Book and Meal Planning using Elasticsearch
- And much much more!
