I was a member of the UNH Class of 2010 where I studied Computer Science. My
major focuses of study were kernel design, operating system design, and
algorithm analysis. I also worked for four years during my undergraduate tenure
at UNH working at the InterOperability Laboratory (UNH-IOL) working on testing
next generation iWARP, Infiniband, Fibre Channel, and FCoE devices.

After graduating from UNH, I moved to Raleigh, North Carolina to start
my professional career at NetApp. While there, I helped to develop the
FlexPod reference architecture, which consisted of NetApp storage and Cisco
networking and compute. I also was a software engineer working on integrations
with other partners, including Red Hat, Citrix, and VMware. I was also a
member of the OpenStack team at NetApp testing the Cinder and Manila drivers
for NetApp's storage controllers.

I am now employed at Red Hat in beautiful Downtown Raleigh where I
continue to work on OpenStack, specifically in raising the quality of the
Shared File System service, Manila.

I'm a software quality engineer by day, but by night, I am a musician,
gamer, reader, and tinkerer. I play bass guitar in a local cover band and I
also collaborate on creating video game cover music on YouTube. I enjoy
video games that can bring me into their story and gameplay and allow me to
ask questions about the design and programming choices made. I love to read and
write as well, being a little bit of a writing nerd as well.
